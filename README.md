# Sorting Algorithms


## Introduction
This repository contains various sorting algorithms implemented in the C programming language. Sorting algorithms are fundamental tools in computer science used to arrange elements in a particular order, such as ascending or descending. Each algorithm comes with its own C code implementation, explanations, and performance analysis.

## Getting Started

You can explore the individual sorting algorithms by navigating in files in the repository. Each file contains the C source code,  along with comments and explanations to help you understand the algorithm's logic and implementation, and the Big O notations of the time complexity of each sorting algorithm
